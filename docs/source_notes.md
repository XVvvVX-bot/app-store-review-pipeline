# App Store Source Notes

## Apple RSS Sparse Empty Pages

Apple's iTunes customer reviews RSS can return pages with no `feed.entry` values while still including a `next` link. A later page in the same `1..10` window can contain review rows.

The pipeline therefore treats empty pages with `next` links as sparse pages and continues until the page cap or `--max-consecutive-empty-pages` is reached. This avoids stopping on page 1 when page 2, page 3, or later pages still contain reviews.

## App Store HTML Pages

Public App Store product pages are useful for verification. The HTML commonly includes JSON-LD aggregate rating metadata and a visible `Ratings & Reviews` section.

Live checks on June 18, 2026 showed examples where RSS returned an empty page but HTML clearly had review signals:

- Peacock: App Store HTML showed about 3.4M ratings and visible review cards.
- WhatsApp: App Store HTML showed about 18M ratings and visible review cards.
- YouTube: App Store HTML showed about 47.7M ratings.

However, HTML pages are not a better primary bulk review source:

- The product page and `see-all=reviews` page expose only a small visible set of review cards in browser checks.
- The HTML shape is less stable than the RSS JSON structure.
- The aggregate rating count proves review presence, but does not provide a complete review-row feed.

Use HTML or Playwright checks as diagnostics for source health and coverage, not as the main ingestion path.
